# Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm â€“ Intuition Notes âœ¨

## What are we solving?
We want the **maximum sum of a contiguous subarray**.  
ðŸ‘‰ Example: `[âˆ’2, 1, âˆ’3, 4, âˆ’1, 2, 1, âˆ’5, 4]` â†’ Answer = `6` (from `[4, âˆ’1, 2, 1]`).

---

## Key Intuition
- Imagine you are **walking through the array**, carrying a bag (`currSum`).
- At each step:
  - If adding the current number makes the bag **heavier in a good way** (positive gain) â†’ keep it.
  - If the bag becomes **too heavy negatively (sum < 0)** â†’ throw the bag away and start fresh from the next element.
- Along the walk, always note the **heaviest bag you carried** â†’ thatâ€™s the max subarray sum.

---

## Why reset when sum < 0?
- A negative `currSum` will **drag down any future sum**.
- Better to start fresh at the next element â†’ since adding a negative prefix can never help.

---

## Step-by-Step Thought Flow
1. `currSum` = best sum **ending at current index**.
2. `maxSum` = best sum **found so far**.
3. Update rule:  
   - Either **extend old subarray** (`currSum + x`)  
   - Or **start new at x**.

---

## Complexity
- **Time:** `O(n)` â†’ one pass.
- **Space:** `O(1)` â†’ only two variables.

---

## Quick Reminders
- Works with positives + negatives.
- If all numbers are negative â†’ still gives the **largest (least negative) number**.

## Mental Picture ðŸ§ 
Kadane =  
- *"Grow the subarray as long as it helps me."*  
- *"Drop it the moment it hurts me."*
